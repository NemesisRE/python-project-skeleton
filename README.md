# Python skeleton
This skeleton is based on **Learn Python the hard way** [Exercise 46][https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/ex46.html] but it should be compatible with
python2 and python3

## Using the Skeleton

Whenever you want to start a new project, just do this:

1. Make a copy of your skeleton directory. Name it after your new project.
2. Rename (move) the `NAME` directory to be the name of your project or whatever you want to call your root module.
3. Edit your `setup.py` to have all the information for your project.
4. Rename `tests/NAME_tests.py` to also have your module name.
5. Double check it's all working by using `nosetests` again.
6. Start coding.
